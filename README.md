## Zig Vendoring Package Manager
# [1] Reason 
There is not an official package manager: There is ZigMod, There is Gyro, and we have submodules

## Why Vendoring
Because I hate having to build an exe and be crying that some dependencies are broken, that some libs are not intended, etc.
I am salty

## Can we not... vendor?
Yeah, you can, I mean, who stops you putting in however you control your ignore files

## Can We use C or other deps
Well, I hope it does lol, it finds the build.zig or start file you ask, but you can pass a custom child command to build and link it

## You hate me?
Yes, I hate you, like I hate myself.

## Is this a cry for help

Yes
